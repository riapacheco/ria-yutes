# Yutes

Yutes is a collection of bare bones scss utility (yutes) classes for basic structure & color experimentation.

- adjust as you code/go.

## I created this so I could:

- Get up and running fast.
- Lots of scss frameworks have too much bloat with flex-box / column styling.
- Let the design evolve on its own.

> Design, for me, tends to evolve with patterns that do repeat themselves, but sometimes fall outside 'norms'. Because of this, I enjoy having the ability to adjust things like breakpoints and color from a set standard, but with the ability to customize on a _per-element_ or _per-selector_ basis; because sometimes it's the actual utility of something that tells you what the standard should be.
